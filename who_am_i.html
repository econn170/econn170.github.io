        <h2>empathy, curiosity, creativity</h2>
        <p>my name's ellie! i am an enthusiastic and driven information researcher. i’ve worked in data analysis, project and product management, and user experience in startup, university, and corporate settings, and am passionate about creating organized tech that is understandable and accessible to all people. these passions, along with my love for art, history, and collection, have led me to an interest in library science, with a hope to create information architecture that preserves the rich learnings found in studying the past. my work is guided by three core values:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><b>empathy</b> - i believe we need to first understand people and their experiences before we can create systems for them</li>
            <li><b>curiosity</b> - i have a genuine interest in why the world looks the way it does, and am always open to how it could look different</li>
            <li><b>creativity</b> - i cherish the ways we can express ourselves beyond words or traditional methods - artistic expression is life affirming!</li>
        </ol>
